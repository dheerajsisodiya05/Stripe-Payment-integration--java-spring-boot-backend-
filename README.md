**Project: Stripe Payment Integration **
Implemented Stripe integration using Java Spring Boot & Microservices, building modular payment-processing and stripe-provider services.
Analyzed Stripe integration documentation and collaborated with the team to finalize the end-to-end integration approach.
Developed the stripe-provider service integrating with Rest APIs (Create, Retrieve, Expire Session).
Implemented security mechanisms using Stripe Basic Auth for APIs and HmacSHA256 for notification processing.
Implemented payment status tracking, to ensure 100% reliability of payments.
Developed custom error codes and applied Spring exception handling for robust error management.
Processed incoming Stripe notification events and performed unit testing.
Worked with MySQL (Spring JDBC) and gained hands-on experience with AWS services (EC2, RDS, Secrets Manager).
Explored Spring AI with OpenAI LLM for dynamic Stripe error response handling and integrated ActiveMQ for asynchronous communication
Applied design patterns (Factory, Builder) and OOP principles to build modular, maintainable services.
